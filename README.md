This repository contains machine learning labs and sample models developed as part of Break Through Tech AI, a program hosted by Cornell Tech focused on bridging the gender gap in AI through hands-on technical training and mentorship.

About the Project <br>
Over eight weeks, I completed a series of labs covering the foundations of machine learning, including:
* Data preparation and exploratory data analysis
* Model development and evaluation
* Classification and regression techniques
* Neural network implementation

Each lab is built around real-world datasets and business-relevant challenges, combining theory with application.

Labs Included
* Lab 1: NumPy & Pandas Review
* Lab 2: Data Understanding and Preparation
* Lab 3: Comparing KNNs and Decision Trees
* Lab 4: Logistic Regression from Scratch
* Lab 5: Model Selection for Logistic Regression
* Lab 6: Comparing Regression Models
* Lab 7: Implementing a CNN
* Lab 8: Defining and Solving an ML Problem

Tech Stack
* Languages: Python
* ML & Data Libraries: Scikit-learn, SciPy, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
* Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn

Skills Gained
* End-to-end ML pipeline development
* Model tuning and evaluation
* Neural network implementation
* Business-context model deployment
* Team collaboration and agile project work
